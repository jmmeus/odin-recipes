# odin-recipes
First HTML project from TOP - making a website with a range of recipes.

This project will be a website written (initally) in basic HTML. The website will demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML tags and combining these elements, and my current knowledge, by building a functional website. This will also provide a basis for future developments that will allow me to improve this website. This will include primarily CSS, and likely JS in the future too.
